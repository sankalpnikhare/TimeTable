# TimeTable
I often found it difficult to keep track of which class or period was going on at a given time, so I created this timetable project in C. The program fetches the real-time system clock and current day, then displays the ongoing period based on a predefined schedule. It's a simple yet handy tool for students like me to stay organized throughout the day.
